# oblivionSocial



Social media app for Qortal. So far its just the framework for posts. It needs thumbs up and down and a feed. Needs comments on posts. Top 25 topics stay trending, beyond that gets cut off of the feed. Stored in localStorage, need to figure out how to delete the posts that fall out of the top 25 or old posts when storage goes over 5Mb.
