# oblivionSocial



Social media app for Qortal. So far its just the framework for posts in Typescript and react. It needs thumbs up and down and a feed of the top rated posts/threads. Needs comments on posts. content stored in localStorage, need to figure out how to delete the posts when storage goes over 5Mb.
