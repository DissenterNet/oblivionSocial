# oblivionSocial



Social media app for Qortal.
So far its just the framework for posts in Typescript and react.

Needs thumbs up and down function.
Needs a feed of the top rated posts/threads.
Needs comments function on posts/threads.
Content is stored in localStorage, we need to figure out how to delete the posts when storage goes over 5Mb.
Need a system to chose a chat name. Stored in a cookie if possible or sessionStorage.
